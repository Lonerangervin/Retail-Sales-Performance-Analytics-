Retail Sales Power BI Dashboard

Retail- Sales Performance Analytics
Location: Remote, Self-Initiated (Nairobi, Kenya) 
Project Duration: 2025 
Tools Used: SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Jupyter Notebook, Excel

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail store sales performance using Power BI to transform raw transactional data into meaningful, actionable insights. Through interactive dashboards, the analysis explores sales behavior across different time periods, product categories, and business dimensions to uncover trends, patterns, and performance drivers.

The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making by presenting key metrics and visual summaries that help stakeholders quickly understand overall sales health, identify high- and low-performing segments, and observe changes in sales over time. Interactive filters and visuals allow users to drill down into specific areas of interest, making the analysis both flexible and intuitive.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, data modeling, KPI definition, and visualization design, with an emphasis on clarity, usability, and business relevance. It serves as both a learning exercise and a portfolio-ready example of applying Power BI to real-world retail data analysis.

* A Power BI visualization file (`.pbix`)
* The raw retail sales dataset (`.csv`) used for analysis

Objectives

* Analyze overall retail sales performance
* Identify sales trends across time
* Compare performance by product category and other dimensions
